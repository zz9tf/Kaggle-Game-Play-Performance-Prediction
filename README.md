# Kaggle Competition: Online Educational Game Time Series Analysis

This repository contains my solution for the Online Educational Game Time Series Analysis Kaggle competition. The objective of the competition is to use time series data generated by an online educational game to predict whether players will answer questions correctly.

## Dataset Description

The competition uses Kaggle's time series API. The training data consists of 18 questions for each session, with the label rows identified with <session_id>_<question #>. Each session will have 18 rows, representing 18 questions. The label consists of whether the user answered the question correctly or not. Test data will be delivered in groupings that do not allow access to future data.

## Files
File | description
-|-
train.csv | the training set
test.csv | the test set
train_labels.csv | the correct values for all 18 questions for each session in the training set
sample_submission.csv | a sample submission file in the correct format

In train file:

Columns | Explaination
-|-
session_id | the ID of the session the event took place in
index| the index of the event for the session
elapsed_time| how much time has passed (in milliseconds) between the start of the session and when the event was recorded
event_name| the name of the event type
name| the event name (e.g. identifies whether a notebook_click is opening or closing the notebook)
level| what level of the game the event occurred in (0 to 22)
page| the page number of the event (only for notebook-related events)
room_coor_x| the coordinates of the click in reference to the in-game room (only for click events)
room_coor_y| the coordinates of the click in reference to the in-game room (only for click events)
screen_coor_x| the coordinates of the click in reference to the player’s screen (only for click events)
screen_coor_y| the coordinates of the click in reference to the player’s screen (only for click events)
hover_duration| how long (in milliseconds) the hover happened for (only for hover events)
text| the text the player sees during this event
fqid| the fully qualified ID of the event
room_fqid| the fully qualified ID of the room the event took place in
text_fqid| the fully qualified ID of the text the player sees during this event
fullscreen| whether the player is in fullscreen mode
hq| whether the game is in high-quality
music| whether the game music is on or off
level_group| which group of levels - and group of questions - this row belongs to (0-4, 5-12, 13-22)

## Approach

My solution involved using time series analysis and feature engineering to extract relevant features and build predictive models. I used a combination of classical time series models and machine learning algorithms to generate predictions for the test data. I also focused on optimizing my models for efficiency, given the compute constraints of the competition.

## Results
My final model achieved a [insert score or rank] on the public leaderboard and a [insert score or rank] on the private leaderboard.

## Usage

- Clone this repository.
- Download the competition data from [insert link to competition data].
- Extract the data and place it in the data directory.
- Run the notebook main.ipynb to generate
